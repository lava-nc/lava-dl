    "# MNIST Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `lava.lib.dl.netx` API to classify MNIST images using an already trained `lava.lib.dl.slayer` network; i.e., we do _no_ training here, just inference. The classification is done on both: CPU (via $\\texttt{Loihi2SimCfg}$) and on Loihi-2 neuro-cores (via $\\texttt{Loihi2HwCfg}$). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this inference tutorial is part of the **end-to-end training** and **evaluation** tutorial: [mnist-on-loihi](https://github.com/R-Gaurav/mnist-on-loihi) -- it contains all the inference code explained here, as well as the `slayer` training code to obtain the trained network-weights (used here). The `slayer` training procedure is also explained in the [accompanying tutorial](https://r-gaurav.github.io/2024/04/13/Lava-Tutorial-MNIST-Training-on-GPU-and-Evaluation-on-Loihi2.html) and is quite straight-forward. However, when it comes to inference, there are some tips-and-tricks to keep in mind while evaluating the trained `slayer`-network via `netx`; and that's precisely the point of this tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "## `slayer` Network Architecture\n",
    "The architecture of the trained `slayer`-network is as follows: \n",
    "$$\\texttt{Dense CUBA(128)} \\rightarrow \\texttt{Dense CUBA(64)} \\rightarrow \\texttt{Dense CUBA(10)}$$\n",
    "where, `Dense` denotes the fully connected `Dense` connection, and `CUBA(m)` denotes $\\texttt{m}$ Current Based neurons. Note that the first **Hidden** layer: $\\texttt{Dense CUBA(128)}$ accepts $784$-dimensional rate-encoded spikes (of the flattened MNIST images), and the (last) **Output** layer: $\\texttt{Dense CUBA(10)}$ consists of $10$ output neurons denoting the classes; classification is done on the maximally spiking output neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loihi-2 deployment\n",
    "To deploy and evaluate the above (trained) `slayer`-network on Loihi-2 boards, we are going to load it via `netx` and connect **Input** and **Output** `Process`es (to its ends), which will encode the test-image to input spikes and predict the class from the output spikes, respectively. Note that since the `slayer`-network is loaded via `netx`, we also call it as <ins>`netx`-obtained network</ins> here (and use the terms interchangeably as appropriate); the architecture for Loihi-2 deployment is _conceptually_ going to look like: **Input** `Process` -> `netx`-obtained network -> **Output** `Process`.\n",
